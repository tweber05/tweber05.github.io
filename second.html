  <h1>How to do Laundry</h1>
<ol>
  <li>Gather all of the dirty clothes</li>
  <li>Sort the colorful clothes from the black clothes</li>
  <li>Also sort the under clothes from the rest of the clothes</li>
  <li>After sorting all the clothes, you can start washing</li>
</ol>

<h2>Other Tips</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Make sure there is nothing in pants or coat pockets</li>
    <li>Under clothes get washed by themselves, or with whites</li>
    <li>Jeans can be washed with towels and sweatshirts</li>
</ul>

<h3>Last Step</h3>

<p>The last thing you do once the laundry is wased, is dry it. Drying is up to you. Some clothes should be hung up to air dry. Others are okay to put in the dryer.</p>

<h4>Good Luck</h4>
