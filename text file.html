each div is 350px
box-sizing; border-box lines both boxes up ontop of each other
float right moves both divs to the right of the page, next to each other
float left moves both divs to the left of the page, next to each other
the divs don't move or resize
the divs go to the side of the page that they are floated to
testDiv1 becomes skinny and long and gets cut off the page because it is too long

my divs stretch long ways down the page when the page is resized
