<h1>
  Jabberwocky
</h1>

'Twas brillig, and the slithy toves
Did gyre and gimble in the wabe:
All mimsy were the borogoves,
And the mome raths outgrabe.

<section>
  'Beware the Jabberwock, my son!
The jaws that bite, the claws that catch!
Beware the Jubjub bird, and shun
The frumious Bandersnatch!'
</section>

<section id="container4">
  He took his vorpal sword in hand:
Long time the manxome foe he sought --
So rested he by the Tumtum tree,
And stood a while in thought.
</section id="container4">

<p>
  And, as in uffish thought he stood,
The Jabberwock, with eyes of flame,
Came whiffling through the tulgey wood,
And burbled as it came!
</p>

One two! One two! And through and through
The vorpal blade went snicker-snack!
He left it dead, and with its head
He went galumphing back.

<h2>
'And hast thou slain the Jabberwock?
</h2>
Come to my arms, my beamish boy!
Oh frabjous day! Callooh! Callay!'
He chortled in his joy.

'Twas brillig, and the slithy toves
Did gyre and gimble in the wabe:
All mimsy were the borogoves,
And the mome raths outgrabe.

<ul>
  The Walrus and the Carpenter
The sun was shining on the sea,
Shining with all his might:
He did his very best to make
The billows smooth and bright --
And this was odd, because it was
The middle of the night.
</ul>

<a href="moon.htm">Moon</a>

<section id="container6">
  The moon was shining sulkily,
Because she thought the sun
Had got no business to be there
</section id="container6">

<section id="container7">
After the day was done --
'It's very rude of him.' she said,
'To come and spoil the fun!'
</section id="container7">

<strong>The sea was wet as wet could be,</strong>
The sands were dry as dry.
You could not see a cloud, because
No cloud was in the sky:
No birds were flying overhead --
There were no birds to fly.

<h3>
The Walrus and the Carpenter
</h3>

<img src="Caterpillar.jpg" alt="Caterpillar">

Were walking close at hand:
They wept like anything to see
Such quantities of sand:
'If this were only cleared away,'
They said, 'it would be grand.'

'If seven maids with seven mops
Swept it for half a year,
Do you suppose,' the Walrus said,
'That they could get it clear?'
'l doubt it,' said the Carpenter,
And shed a bitter tear.

<ul>
'O Oysters, come and walk with us!
The Walrus did beseech.
</ul>
'A pleasant walk, a pleasant talk,
<ul>
Along the briny beach:
We cannot do with more than four,
To give a hand to each.'
</ul>

The eldest Oyster looked at him,
But never a word he said:
The eldest Oyster winked his eye,
And shook his heavy head --
Meaning to say he did not choose
To leave the oyster-bed.

<h4>
  Out four young Oysters hurried up.
</h4>
All eager for the treat:
Their coats were brushed, their faces washed,
Their shoes were clean and neat --
And this was odd, because, you know,
They hadn't any feet.

Four other Oysters followed them,
And yet another four;
And thick and fast they came at last,
And more, and more, and more --
All hopping through the frothy waves,
And scrambling to the shore.

<ol>
<li>The Walrus and the Carpenter
<li>Walked on a mile or so,
<li>And then they rested on a rock
<li>Conveniently low:
<li>And all the little Oysters stood
</ol>
And waited in a row.

'The time has come,' the Walrus said,
'To talk of many things:
<div id="container8">
  Of shoes -- and ships -- and sealing wax --
Of cabbages -- and kings --
And why the sea is boiling hot --
And whether pigs have wings.'
</div id="container8">

'But wait a bit,' the Oysters cried,
'Before we have our chat;
For some of us are out of breath,
And all of us are fat!'
'No hurry!' said the Carpenter.
They thanked him much for that.

<div id="container1">
  'A loaf of bread,' the Walrus said,
'Is what we chiefly need:
Pepper and vinegar besides
Are very good indeed --
</div id="container1">

<div id="container2">
Now, if you're ready, Oysters dear,
We can begin to feed.'
</div id="container2">


'But not on us!' the Oysters cried,
Turning a little blue.
'After such kindness, that would be
A dismal thing to do!'
'The night is fine,' the Walrus said,
'Do you admire the view?'

<h5>
'It was so kind of you to come!
</h5>
And you are very nice!'
The Carpenter said nothing but
'Cut us another slice-
I wish you were not quite so deaf-
I've had to ask you twice!'

'It seems a shame,' the Walrus said,
'To play them such a trick.
After we've brought them out so far,
And made them trot so quick!'
The Carpenter said nothing but
'The butter's spread too thick!'

<h6>
'I weep for you,'the Walrus said:
</h6>

'I deeply sympathize.'
With sobs and tears he sorted out
Those of the largest size,
Holding his pocket-handkerchief
Before his streaming eyes.

'O Oysters,' said the Carpenter,
'You've had a pleasant run!
Shall we be trotting home again?'
But answer came there none --
And this was scarcely odd, because

They'd eaten every one.
